════ mike’s code style guide ════

I have a lot of implicit hand-wavy rules about code structure and style which I
never really formalised anywhere. Mostly this is because I don’t believe in
having a totally rigid set of formatting rules and instead try to make the form
of each chunk of code the best compromise for that particular bit of code.

A lot of that is based on vibes and subjective judgement. There are essentially
no hard rules.

This document aims to state some of my thoughts and feelings on such matters so
that anyone looking to contribute patches can at least aim to approximate my
style a little closer. It might also give some insight into why all my code is
so awesome and/or terrible.

Please don’t get too caught up in this though. It’s very unlikely that you’ll
consistently make the exact aesthetic judgements I would make because we don’t
share the same brain. For all intents and purposes, you should be quite happy
not to have my brain, so don’t worry about it.

Also, this guide does not pertain to the actual programming logic side of
things. For that, you should refer to code-standards.txt , once that is written.
The plan is to get round to that at some point eventually.

══ First, the hard rules ══

Okay, I lied, there actually are some hard rules, but mostly about the actual
data on disk rather than anything stylistic:

• Source files are text files. This means every line ends in with an end-of-line
  character (\n), including the last line. If your editor mistreats the final \n
  as an extra blank line, that’s a you problem. Lines without end-of-lines are
  not lines and text files ending in non-lines are not text files. I will die on
  this hill.

• \r\n is not a line ending. It is an erroneous carriage return character,
  followed by a line ending. Your source files generally should not include
  weird non-printable characters, least of all at the end of every single line.
  Exception: Windows batch files, which require a carriage return at the end of
  each line to ensure that labels/gotos work correctly.

• Git for Windows is configured to wildly misbehave by default. If you have not
  set core.eol=lf and core.autocrlf=false prior to cloning this repo, and Git
  starts mangling file contents in confusing ways, then that’s a you problem.

• SST uses UTF-8-encoded source files. It should go without saying but there
  should be no BOM. Generally comments will use ASCII only for ease of typing,
  although we use Unicode in the copyright headers to be fancy, because we can,
  and if you gain something by putting Unicode characters in a doc comment, then
  hell, go for it.

• String literals with Unicode in them should put the UTF-8 straight in the
  literal rather than doing the obfuscated \U nonsense. Although, be aware that
  the environment SST runs in is prone to completely bungling Unicode display,
  so most user-facing strings inside the codebase are gonna be limited to ASCII.

• No spaces or Unicode in file paths. That’s just obnoxious.

• We use tabs for indentation, and line width guidelines (see below) assume a
  tab width of 4 spaces, but you can configure this to 8 or something for
  reading purposes if you prefer. This configurability is one reason we don’t
  indent with spaces. Another reason is that text editors still behave more
  stupid with spaces. I don’t care what anyone says about how a good editor will
  make spaces feel exactly the same as tabs. Empirical evidence shows that that
  is clearly bollocks.

• The asterisk goes on the right in pointer declarations. This is dictated by
  the syntax and semantics of the language. Putting it on the left is
  misleading, and looks wrong to most C programmers — as it should, because it
  is. People coming from C++ may have to unlearn a bad habit here, but on the
  plus side, when they go back to C++, they can do it correctly there now too!

• No spaces between function names and parentheses. Yes spaces between control
  flow keywords and parentheses. No space padding inside parentheses. Also no
  space padding inside braces for initialisers, although yes spaces for small
  struct declarations. Don’t ask me why on that last one, it’s just how I do it.

• Spaces around all arithmetic operators. No spaces around dots or arrows;
  hopefully this one’s not contentious‽

• Spaces between string literal pieces and/or macros representing literal
  pieces. This one’s actually a dumb C++ one that can probably go but it’s
  everywhere and I don’t really care so just stick to it for consistency.

• No spaces between casts and castees.

• Just look at the code. Do what the code does. The rest of the rules will cover
  nebulous edge cases but these really basic things should be easy. I trust you!

══ Nebulous formatting and whitespace guidelines ══

In no particular order:

• Usually each statement should go on its own line for obvious reasons, but very
  simple statements that are very closely related can go together if it improves
  the information density of the code without sacrificing clarity.

  Rationale:
  I like to maximise the amount of information being conveyed in the smallest
  amount of space, especially on the vertical axis. Being able to fit more
  context on screen at once makes it easier to keep track of what’s going on in
  complex regions of code.

  Bad example:
    ++x;
    ++y;
    ++z;

  Good example:
    ++x; ++y; ++z;

• Try and keep lines under 80 characters. If wrapping would look really stupid
  and unbalanced and the last character on the line is not important to the
  understanding of the line, 81 might do. In very rare cases, we can suffer 82.

  Rationale:
  People who argue about We Don’t Use 80 Character Terminals Any More™ are
  missing the point. Really long lines are just obnoxious to read. Plus, it’s
  nice to be able to fit 3 or 4 files on screen side-by-side (or views of the
  same file if it’s a big one!). However, sometimes you just need to squeeze in
  a semicolon and realistically 80 is an arbitrary limit, so it’s okay to apply
  something like the TeX badness system where you trade one form of ugliness for
  a lesser form. In this case, an overly long line to avoid really ugly wrapping.

• Continue hard-wrapped lines with 2 tabs of indentation.

  Rationale:
  I don’t have a good reason for this. I used to do it in Java when I was a
  child and now my editor still does it by default in C so it’s just kind of
  what I do. I think it looks fine and at least one other option is worse.

  “Bad” example:
    if (cond1 &&
      cond2) {
        do_thing();
    }

  “Good” example:
    if (cond1 &&
            cond2) {
        do_thing();
    }

• Try to hard-wrap lines at a natural reading break point. Don’t just wrap on a
  word if you can keep an entire string literal or struct initialiser together
  for instance. This is ultimately a subjective judgement, but do your best.

  Rationale:
  Keeping individual _things_ like strings or structs together makes it a little
  easier to scan with the eyes. It also makes it a lot easier to grep. If you
  break a string into lines mid-phrase, grep is ruined. If you really need to
  break up a long string literal, at least putting the break between sentences
  will make grepping less likely to fail.

  Bad example:
    errmsg_warn("could not do operation with rather lengthy description: failed"
            " to lookup that important thing");

  Good example:
    errmsg_warn("could not do operation with rather lengthy description: "
            "failed to lookup that important thing");

• Hard wrap a little earlier if it avoids leaving a single dangling token which,
  as with poorly-typeset prose, just looks stupid.

  Rationale:
  You want something substantial on each line for your eyes to lock onto. Dangly
  diminutive tailpieces look stupid and ugly and have no friends.

  Bad example:
    call_function("parameter 1 takes up some space", param_2 + 5, another_var,
            x);

  Good example:
    call_function("parameter 1 takes up some space", param_2 + 5,
            another_var, x);

  Maybe better example (it’s up to you):
    call_function("parameter 1 takes up some space",
            param_2 + 5, another_var, x);

  Note: that maybe better example would become a definitely better example if
  the middle two (or last three) parameters were related in some way.

• Don’t hard wrap before punctuation. Closing parentheses, commas, semicolons,
  conditional operators and so on should remain attached to a preceding token.

  Rationale:
  Starting a line with punctuation in code looks just as wonky to me as it would
  in natural language prose. Ending on punctuation also primes my brain to read
  a continuation on the next line.

  Bad example:
    if (cond1
            && cond2)

  Good example:
    if (cond1 &&
            cond2)

• An open brace should always be on the same line as the function header or
  conditional statement that precedes it. Even if a line is wrapped, do not
  leave the brace on its own. Take something else with it.

  Rationale:
  I prefer the visual flow of a brace being attached to a thing and think it
  looks kind of silly on its own line. I also strongly avoid wasting vertical
  space in most cases.

  Bad example:
    void my_function_name()
    {
      // ...
    }

  Good example:
    void my_function_name() {
      // ...
    }

• Control flow statements should always use braces if the body is on its own
  line, even if it’s only one statement. No classic Unix/BSD-style hanging
  statements.

  Rationale:
  It’s harder to introduce stupid bugs if the addition of a new statement to a
  block does not require fiddling with braces, and it’s less editing work to add
  or remove statements when the braces are always there. Braces also provide a
  stronger visual association with the controlling statement than just an
  indent.

  Bad example:
    if (err)
        invoke_error_handler(err, context, "tried to do thing and it failed!");

  Good example:
    if (err) {
        invoke_error_handler(err, context, "tried to do thing and it failed!");
    }

• If a control flow statement and its associated single statement can fit on one
  line, then go ahead and do that, with no need for braces. If there’s more than
  one statement but they’re very trivial and/or closely related, a braced
  one-liner is also alright.

  Rationale:
  This saves a ton of vertical space for trivial conditions, especially when
  there’s a bunch of them in a row.

  Bad example:
    if (err) {
        return false;
    }
    if (extrastuff) {
        process_florbs();
        refresh_grumbles();
    }

  Good example:
    if (err) return false;
    if (extrastuff) { process_florbs(); refresh_grumbles(); }

• Paired if/else statements should either both be one-liners (or maybe even a
  one-liner altogether), or both use braces. No mixing and matching.

  Rationale:
  This improves the visual rhythm and consistency when reading through the file.
  It reduces the extent to which a reader’s eyes must jump around the screen to
  find the correct bit of text to read.

  Bad example:
    if (!p) errmsg_warn("unexpected null value");
    else {
        p->nsprungles += 71;
        defrombulate(p);
        errmsg_note("we do be defrombulating them sprungles!!!");
    }

  Good example:
    if (!p) {
        errmsg_warn("unexpected null value");
    }
    else {
        p->nsprungles += 71;
        defrombulate(p);
        errmsg_note("we do be defrombulating them sprungles!!!");
    }

• When putting the else on its own line, put it on its own line. Don’t hug the
  closing brace of the if.

  Rationale:
  Having the if and else line up in the same column looks better to me when
  scanning vertically through the file. It also makes it easier to edit and move
  things around when selection can be done linewise, and easier to comment stuff
  out temporarily for debugging and such.

  Bad example:
    if (cond) {
        do_some_cool_stuff();
    } else {
        do_something_else();
    }

  Good example:
    if (cond) {
        do_some_cool_stuff();
    }
    else {
        do_something_else();
    }

• If there are a bunch of related conditionals in a row, and only some of them
  fit on one line, consider keeping them all braced to improve the visual
  symmetry.

  Rationale:
  This reads better, similarly to the if-else example, and is easier to edit.

  Bad example:
    if (cond1) return;
    if (cond2 || flag3 == THIS_IS_VERY_LONG_BY_COMPARISON) {
        do_other_thing(false);
    }
    if (cond3 || flag3 == SHORTER_ONE) continue;

  Good example (note that this one is way more subjective and case-by-case!):
    if (cond1) {
        return;
    }
    if (cond2 || flag3 == THIS_IS_VERY_LONG_BY_COMPARISON) {
        do_other_thing(false);
    }
    if (cond3 || flag3 == SHORTER_ONE) {
        continue;
    }

• Favour inter-line visual symmetry over compactness of any individual line.

  Rationale:
  Basically a generalised form of many of these other rules. It seemed like a
  good idea to just state this outright. Plus, it lets me give a very specific
  example that would be hard to shoehorn in elsewhere.

  Bad example:
  x[0] = y[0]; x[1] = y[1]; x[2] = y[2]; x[3] = y[3]; x[4] = y[4];
  x[5] = y[5]; x[6] = y[6]; x[7] = y[7];

  Good example:
  x[0] = y[0]; x[1] = y[1]; x[2] = y[2]; x[3] = y[3];
  x[4] = y[4]; x[5] = y[5]; x[6] = y[6]; x[7] = y[7];

• Spread large struct initialisers over multiple lines. Don’t do the usual
  two-tab hard wrapping, but instead do a brace indent thing and put each member
  on a line.

  Rationale:
  Visual weight and symmetry, and ease of amendment. As usual.

  Bad example:
    struct gizmo g = {"this string exists to make the example line long!", 15,
            sizeof(whatever)};

  Good example:
    struct gizmo g = {
        "this string exists to make the example line long!",
        15,
        sizeof(whatever)
    };

• As an exception to the above, very closely related things might go on the same
  line. Use judgement as to whether that grouping makes things clearer or worse.

  Rationale:
  Hopefully by now the theme is emerging that I value hard rule consistency less
  than moment-to-moment clarity. In cases where most things are on different
  lines, grouping things on the same line can sometimes aid clarity and/or
  information density. It’s the same idea as grouping statements/declarations.

  Examples: N/A. This is way too subjective and situational to make up a
  contrived example. But you’ll see it sometimes in my code and you’re welcome
  to do it yourself whenever the vibes are right. It’s all just vibes.

• Declare multiple *related* variables of the same type on one line as a
  comma-separated list.

  Rationale:
  This makes things more terse and compact in cases when the grouping is
  obvious. As soon as the declarations need to span multiple lines, there seems
  to be less benefit to doing this, but in cases where there’s a small number of
  things and the compaction creates no real loss of clarity, it makes sense.

  Bad example:
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
    char *x;
    char *y;

  Good example (assuming these things are related):
    int a, b, c;
    char *x, *y;

• Cram goto labels into the indent margins, on the same line as the actual code.

  Rationale:
  Labels can introduce visual noise, especially in the case of many cascading/
  unwinding error cleanup handlers. Considering that goto use tends to be
  limited, it doesn’t seem that important to give highly descriptive names to
  labels.

  Bad example:
    void myfunc() {
        if (!thing1()) goto err_1;
        if (!thing2()) goto err_2;
        return true;

    err_2:
        cleanup1();
    err_1:
        cleanup2();
        return false;
    }

  Good example:
    void myfunc() {
        if (!thing1()) goto e1;
        if (!thing2()) goto e2;
        return true;

    e2: cleanup1();
    e1: cleanup2();
        return false;
    }

• Don’t indent preprocessor directives.

  Rationale:
  The preprocessor is its own meta language and it’s not really helpful to
  intermingle it with the main control flow syntax. It also just kind of looks
  subjectively messy to have preprocessor stuff reaching far across the screen.
  I do see the argument for indenting nested ifdefs, but usually there’s few
  enough of them that it won’t be that confusing either way and in cases where
  there’s a lot of nesting… well, you have bigger problems.

  Bad example:
    #ifndef _WIN32
        #ifdef __LP64__
            #define IS64BIT 1
        #else
            #define IS64BIT 0
        #endif
    #endif

  Good example:
    #ifndef _WIN32
    #ifdef __LP64__
    #define IS64BIT 1
    #else
    #define IS64BIT 0
    #endif
    #endif

• Use C++/C99-style comments for explanatory notes, and classic C-style comments
  for documentation in headers etc. As an exception, C-style comments can be
  used inside multi-line macro bodies with line continuation, but should not be
  padded with extra asterisks in such cases.

  Rationale:
  It’s nice to have a way to quickly visually distinguish public documentation
  from internal notes. To me, the single-line comments have a bit less formality
  about them, so they’re good for quickly jotting something down, whereas the
  big banner comments stand out a bit more like formal declarations of important
  information.

  Bad example:
    // This function computes the sum of two integers. It assumes the result
    // will not overflow.
    int sum(int x, int y) {
        return x + y; /* no need for a comment here but this is an example! */
    }

    #define DO_INTERESTING_CALCULATION() do { \
        /*
         * There's quite a lot to explain here. We not only have to increment
         * one of the numbers, but we also have to multiply the result by
         * another number, and then multiply that by yet another number, and add
         * 9 to that. This behaviour is specified in detail in one of the WHATWG
         * specs, presumably.
         */ \
        ++foo; \
        bar *= foo; \
        baz = baz * bar + 9; \
    } while (0)

  Good example:
    /*
     * This function computes the sum of two integers. It assumes the result
     * will not overflow.
     */
    int sum(int x, int y) {
        return x + y; // no need for a comment here but this is an example!
    }

    #define DO_INTERESTING_CALCULATION() do { \
        /* There's quite a lot to explain here. We not only have to increment
           one of the numbers, but we also have to multiply the result by
           another number. I won't repeat the entire stupid joke again. */ \
        ++foo; \
        bar *= foo; \
        baz = baz * bar + 9; \
    } while (0)

    Caveat: note that generally the /**/ documentation comments should also go
    in the header rather than the implementation file, as this allows for both
    easy manual reading and LSP hover support, but whatever, you get the idea.

• Put short comments pertaining to single lines of code at the ends of those
  lines if you can make them fit. Otherwise, write them above the relevant code.
  Do not continue an end-of-line comment onto an over-indented blank line.

  Rationale:
  Probably obvious by now. Don’t waste space. Having comments hang off the ends
  of lines and melt down the right-hand side of the screen not only wastes space
  but also makes you look like a child writing with crayons.

  Bad example:
    if (cond1 || cond2) reasonably_long_call(param1); // either conditiom can
                                                      // trigger this here due
                                                      // to that thing I
                                                      // mentioned.
  Good example:
    // either condition can trigger this here due to that thing I mentioned.
    if (cond1 || cond2) reasonably_long_call(param1);

  Pro tip: if you use Vim or Neovim as I do, consider doing set fo-=oc in your
  config to stop this dangling idiocy from happening when you take a new line.

══ The second hard problem in computer science ══

… Naming things!

Firstly we have some rules about interfacing with Valve’s code, since that’s
kind of a core thing we have to do in this project:

• Use exact SDK names (where known) for Source engine types (structs/classes).

  Rationale:
  This makes it trivial to look things up in the official SDK sources. Since the
  naming here differs greatly from the naming elsewhere it stands out as being
  its own thing. There are some exceptions, notably the con_var and con_cmd
  structs which are our names for ConVar and ConCommand. The reasoning for those
  is that they are effectively part of SST’s internal API, so we’ve made them
  stylistically our own.

  Bad example:
    struct baseent {
        void *vtable;
        // ...
    };

  Good example:
    struct CBaseEntity {
        void *vtable;
        // ...
    };

• Generally, prefer exact names for SDK functions too.

  Rationale:
  Same as above; it makes it obvious which bit of the engine we’re referring to.

  Bad example:
    DECL_VFUNC(struct CGameMovement, bool, checkjump)

  Good example:
    DECL_VFUNC(struct CGameMovement, bool, CheckJumpButton)

• Don’t bother with exact names for struct members or other variables.

  Rationale:
  A lot of the time we’re poking into internals and in many cases the variables
  aren’t even at consistent byte offsets from one game version to the next (see
  also gamedata files). Many of Valve’s chosen variable names are also very
  annoying and violate every other guideline you’re about to see, so at the
  granularity of local variables I made the decision long ago to write whatever
  names made sense to me and not worry about it.

  Bad example:
    int buttons = mv->m_iButtons;

  Good example:
    int buttons = mv->buttons;

The rest of these points apply to first-party code, i.e., SST itself:

• Use British English in all first-party code and documentation.

  Rationale:
  I am from Scotland.

  Bad example: static void analyze();
  Good example: static void analyse();

• Functions, variable names and struct/enum tags should all be lowercase.

  Rationale:
    TitleCase is annoying to type and camelCase looks ugly. Most C code uses
    lowercase stuff so this looks the most familiar to most people, probably.

  Bad example:
    int myVar;
    struct MyStruct;

  Good example:
    int myvar;
    struct mystruct;

• typedefs should almost never be used, except for base integer type
  abbrevations (intdefs.h) and function pointers. The latter are annoying to
  write out over and over so the typical convention (in cases like hooking) is
  to declare a FunctionName_func and then use that everywhere else. Even when
  dealing with e.g. Windows APIs which typedef the hell out of everything, try
  to avoid actually using those typedefs unless your hand is truly forced.

  Rationale:
  C doesn’t treat typedefs as different types, so all typedefs really achieve on
  numeric and pointer types is obfuscation. In the case of structs, I always
  liked having the separate struct namespace, and using a typedef obviously goes
  against that. In more recent times I have *somewhat* thought about changing my
  mind on that, but it’d be a big change and I still don’t feel that strongly in
  favour of it. Also, since everything is lowercase, the struct keyword does
  help disambiguate a bit. If we were gonna typedef structs, there’d probably
  also be some discussion about using TitleCase or something.

• const definitions and enum values should be uppercase.

  Rationale:
  This distinguishes them from variables, indicating that they are essentially
  build-time symbols that get substituted by the compiler, similar to macros
  (see also the next point).

  Bad example: static const int maxents = 64;
  Good example: static const int MAXENTS = 64;

  Caveat:
  I feel like I might have unthinkingly broken this rule myself at some point,
  and at the time of writing I’m not intent on doing a full cleanup pass to find
  out. Said cleanup pass is bound to happen at some point though, don’t worry.

• The case of macros… kind of depends. If your macro is a constant, or a
  function-like macro that expands to a blob of context-dependent syntax, then
  it should be uppercase to indicate that it’s effectively also a symbolic
  constant. If your macro essentially behaves as an inline function, then it
  should be lowercase, although you should also consider just writing an inline
  function instead. If your macro aims to extend the syntax of C like the things
  in langext.h, it can also be lowercase in order to look like a real keyword.

  Rationale: I’m very accustomed to using uppercase for constants but not all
  macros behave as constants. My usual goal with macros is for the interface not
  to feel like macros, even if the implementation is macros. That principle
  becomes really important when you see how horrendous some of the macros can
  get under the hood.

  Bad example:
    #define MyConstant 4
    #define FOREACH_THING(x) /* impl here */
    #define doerrorcheck(var) do if (!var) die("couldn't get " #var); while (0)

  Good example:
    #define MYCONSTANT 4
    #define foreach_thing(x) /* impl here */
    #define DOERRORCHECK(var) do if (!var) die("couldn't get " #var); while (0)

• A few special things actually do use TitleCase, namely event names and
  gametype tags.

  Rationale:
  These are sort of special things, and always passed into macros. They’re not
  regular tokens that you’d see anywhere else in the code, so it sort of felt
  right to give them a bit of a different style. Honestly, it’s all just vibes.

  Bad example:
    DEF_EVENT(redraw_copilot_widget)
    X(portal4) /* (in GAMETYPE_BASETAGS in gametype.h) */

  Good example:
    DEF_EVENT(RedrawCopilotWidget)

• Prefer the shortest name you can get away with. If you feel that a longer name
  is necessary for understanding, that is okay. But if you can abbreviate
  without losing too much clarity, then that is a good idea. If your variable is
  local to a small scope you can probably get away with an even shorter name.

  Rationale:
  The only research I’ve seen on the topic indicates that longer names do not
  meaningfully quicken debugging speed even for developers unfamiliar with a
  codebase. Since I prefer higher information density, I strongly prefer
  cramming more structure into the same amount of space via smaller individual
  tokens, rather than having longer and more redundant names. You’ll see a ton
  of abbreviations in this codebase and some of them might seem a bit obtuse to
  begin with, but it seems that other people have been able to get used to that.

  Bad example:
    bool success = check_conditions(has_required_data, parse_integer(input));

  Good example:
    bool ok = checkcond(has_data, parseint(input));

• Try to make a name slightly shorter again if you can avoid wrapping.

  Rationale: all the previous whitespace rules aiming to minimise ugliness can
  often be aided by fudging the actual text a bit. See also: Tom 7’s “Badness 0”
  from SIGBOVIK 2024. https://youtu.be/Y65FRxE7uMc

  Examples: can’t be bothered contriving one of these, but watch that video,
  it’s very funny.

• Underscores are used for namespaces and semantic groupings. Don’t use them as
  spaces. Having two or three words joined without spaces is perfectly fine.

  Rationale:
  Overusing underscores leads to long verbose names, which goes against the
  previous guideline. Calling a variable “gametypeid” instead of “game_type_id”
  is not, in my opinion, that much less readable, and it allows underscores to
  be reserved for a more specific purpose. This is not a hard rule in the event
  that you absolutely insist that an underscore looks significantly better, but
  be prepared for me to ignore your insistence some percentage of the time.

  Examples:
  Exactly the same as above, really. Note the lack of underscores in the good
  example; has_data is an exception because we have a has_ convention throughout
  the codebase; it is essentially a namespace.

• External-linkage (aka public) functions, variables, and structures should be
  prefixed with the module name, which is the source file basename. For
  instance, any part of the API defined in ent.c should generally be named
  ent_something. The same idea goes for uppercase names of macros and enum
  values, usually.

  Rationale:
  This makes it extremely easy to tell where something is defined at a glance.
  It also encourages thinking about where stuff should go, since the best name
  for something will kind of dictate where it belongs *and* vice-versa.

  Examples: N/A. This should be blindingly obvious, come on.

• Special macros that define or declare things will begin with DEF_ or DECL_,
  respectively, rather than following the above rule. Again, there are no hard
  rules. Event handlers use HANDLE_EVENT and the feature.h macros just do
  whatever.

  Rationale:
  In these specific cases, clarity was thought to be aided by having the purpose
  of the macro front and centre, and in the case of DEF/DECL, by grouping them
  semantically with other similar macros across the codebase. Most macros will
  not be subject to such exceptions, but like everything in this codebase, you
  must always allow for exceptions, except in cases where you shouldn’t.

  Examples: N/A.

• Stuff that’s forced to go in public headers but isn’t supposed to be part of
  the interface should be prefixed with an underscore.

  Rationale: this communicates that it’s unstable private API, and also stops it
  from showing up unhelpfully in autocompletion results.

  Bad example: int mything_lookupinternalthingmy();
  Good example: int _mything_lookupinternalthingmy();

══ General naming conventions ══

We have a few recurring patterns in the source, some of which are even required
for certain macros to work correctly! These include:

• vtidx_* for virtual table indices, used by DECL_VFUNC_DYN.
• off_* for offsets to member variables, used by DEF_ACCESSORS.
• sz_* for sizes of structs/classes, used by DEF_ARRAYIDX_ACCESSOR.
• has_* in front of any generated gamedata/entprops value, to indicate the
  presence or absence of a known value at runtime, in the current game/engine.
  Also used in front of a feature name when REQUEST() is specified.

Some other common prefixes and suffixes are just good for making the whole thing
feel coherent to a human reader even if nothing really requires them:

• *_func for function pointer typedefs.
• orig_* for a function pointer used to call an original function from a hook.
• hook_* for the hook function itself, which intercepts calls to the original.
• find_* for a function within a feature which attempts to find some variable or
  function buried within the engine, usually by chasing pointers through machine
  instructions or internal engine data structures or something.

And there’s a bunch of abbreviations I tend to use often without thinking, which
I’ve been told in the past may be confusing to new players:

• ctxt for context
• sz for size
• cb for callback
• msg for message
• cmd for command
• insns for instructions
• ret or sometimes r for any return value
• i for a loop counter or temporary variable
• p or maybe ptr for a temporary pointer
• the first letter of any type name for a temporary variable in a narrow scope

Hopefully you get the idea: there’s a general tendency toward terseness. Usually
the names don’t actually matter that much, to be honest. Most of the guidelines
around naming here have to do with upholding an overall structure and consistent
feeling when reading the codebase rather than worrying about the giving every
individual thing the perfect name. If one thing gets a really dumb name, the sky
will still be up there. You can always rename it later. The thing I mean, not
the sky. And also a sky by any name would smell just as sweet I mean a rose.

══ Miscellany ══

• Trivial but worth mentioning: don’t write void for zero-argument functions.

  Rationale: This is a C23 codebase. () is adequate.
  Bad example: void stub(void);
  Good example: void stub();

• Do still use {0} for default struct initialisation, rather than {}.

  Rationale: C23 is still not that widely supported and I don’t want to demand a
  super-cutting-edge compiler version, in case something breaks. Eventually,
  after the dust has settled, this rule will be flipped over.

  Bad example: struct gizmo g = {}
  Good example: struct gizmo g = {0};

• Always put the & in front of a function when creating a function pointer.

  Rationale: it’s a pointer, innit. No need to rely on legacy implicit weirdness.
  Bad example: regcb(cb);
  Good example: regcb(&cb);

That’s about it, I think.

Thanks, and have fun!
